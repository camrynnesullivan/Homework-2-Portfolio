#Responsive Portfolio

I created a Responsive Portfolio Website that will feature upcoming projects information about who I am, and how to connect with me!

This website is responsive to mobile phones as well as a variety of screen sizes from small to large.

I primarily used Bootstrap to form content within the pages -Jumbotrons, Contact Forms, Card Decks, NavBar, and Footer. I also used fontawesome.com to add social media icons and google fonts to jazz up the site.

Thanks for taking a look!
